Bash Towers are very helpful to have during Boss waves.

Do not build a Research Tower too early. Not applicable for Random Waves.

Your hero can gamble gold to have a chance of hitting the jackpot.

STRING 5907
{
You gain Gold at the end of each wave, the amount of gold gained starts at 200 and slowly increases as you complete more waves by between 10 and 20 gold every wave.

Players that have below average kills they will gain additional gold.

You will lose 10 lives for leaking a boss. Immune Creeps have Divine armour and come every 5 waves.

Some towers are better against some waves than they are against others. Example Chaos tower are good against Immune creeps but are less effective against other creeps.

The spell tower has some usefull spells, such as the stasis trap and and roar, that can really help you against some waves.

If a player leaves, his current gold will be split among the remaining players.

Your Builder will auto-blink if the distance to the point your moving him too is greater than 1200.

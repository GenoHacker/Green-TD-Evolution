This is a repo for the Warcraft 3 Map Green TD Evolution, im mostly just experimenting with a feature in WorldEdit that allows you to save the map as a folder.

The map is entirely made using GUI, i am not a coder/programmer.

It is possible to edit the files directly but aside from mass editing ingame tooltips i have not made any attempts to do so.

To edit the map as i do requires you to own the piece of shit known as Warcraft 3 Reforged, the map will not run on past versions of Warcraft 3

The map in the form of a single file can be made using WorldEdit.

The latest release can always be downloaded from https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/green-td-evolution-v2-05.249982/ or from my discord https://discord.gg/W6wEmT6
